title: "Enhanced User-Friendly GUI for Music Duplicate Finder with Additional Improvements"
objective: "Create an intuitive GUI using Python's Tkinter for a music duplicate finder program, with a focus on robustness and ease of use."

detailed_instructions:
  user_interface_elements: 
    - "Use large, clearly labeled buttons and inputs with tooltips for guidance."
  progress_indicators: 
    - "Include a visible progress bar during the scanning process."
  responsive_design: 
    - "Ensure the GUI remains responsive and informative during scans."
  result_presentation: 
    - "Display results with clear differentiation between file groups and alternating row colors."
  file_deletion_process: 
    - "Implement an intuitive checkbox system for file selection, including a 'Select All' option."
  error_handling: 
    - "Offer clear, understandable error messages with suggestions for common issues."
  user_confirmation:

  technology_stack: 
    - "Use Python 3.8 with Tkinter. Confirm compatibility with the selected Python version."
  data_handling: 
    - "Define logic for scanning music files, focusing on file names and metadata. Specify criteria for duplicate identification."
  backend_integration: 
    - "Employ a modular and object-oriented approach for the integration of GUI and backend logic."
  testing_scenarios: 
    - "Include tests for large music libraries, various file formats, and edge cases."
  deployment_and_usage: 
    - "Provide detailed instructions for installation and usage, tailored for non-technical users."
  documentation: 
    - "Emphasize comprehensive in-code documentation and include a user manual within the application."
