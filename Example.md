### Documentation Sheet: Enhanced User-Friendly GUI for Music Duplicate Finder
## Project Title
Enhanced User-Friendly GUI for Music Duplicate Finder
Objective
Develop an intuitive and straightforward GUI using Python's Tkinter for a music duplicate finder program, focusing on user-friendliness, robustness, and ease of use.
### Detailed Instructions
## User Interface Elements
Implement large, clearly labeled buttons and inputs.
Add tooltips to all interactive elements for user guidance.
## Progress Indicators
Include a visible progress bar or indicator during the scanning process.
## Responsive Design
Ensure the GUI remains responsive and provides updates during scans.
## Result Presentation
Display duplicate results with clear differentiation between file groups.
Use alternating row colors for better readability in the results list.
## File Deletion Process
Implement an intuitive checkbox system for selecting files, including a 'Select All' option.
## Error Handling
Provide clear, understandable error messages with suggestions for common issues.
## User Confirmation for Critical Actions
Require explicit user confirmation for file deletions to prevent accidental data loss.
## Remembering User Preferences
The application should remember the last used folder and settings between sessions.
## Technology Stack and Versioning
Use Python (preferably version 3.8) with Tkinter for GUI development.
## Data Handling and Duplicate Identification
Define logic for scanning music files, focusing on file names and metadata.
Specify criteria for identifying duplicates, such as similarity in file names and metadata comparison.
## Backend Integration
Employ a modular and object-oriented approach for integrating GUI and backend logic.
Separate the GUI code from the logic handling file scanning and deletion.
## Testing Scenarios
Include tests for large music libraries, various file formats, and edge cases like empty folders or unsupported file types.
## Deployment and Usage
Provide detailed instructions for installation and usage, tailored for non-technical users.
## Documentation and Code Comments
Emphasize comprehensive in-code documentation and include a user manual or help section within the application.
## UI/UX Design Considerations
Incorporate design mockups for the GUI layout, if available.
## Additional Guidelines
Focus on creating a clean, modern design for the GUI.
Prioritize making the application intuitive and easy to navigate for users at all skill levels.
